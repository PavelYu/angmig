Here is a clean, structured **summary + actionable TODO list** based strictly on the call.

---

# **Summary**

The team aligned on the overall scope and complexity of the migration plan. Everyone agrees the plan is large, multi-stage, and will require clear navigation and guidance. The hackathon is still targeted for **the second week of December**, but the team wants to stay flexible because timelines may shift once the component list and workshop plan are finalized.

Your immediate next steps are to proceed with:

1. Preparing the **fake components** (schema-level, descriptive, not real code).
2. Updating the **test plan**.
3. Reloading and adjusting the **workshop plan** in the public repo.

Once the initial version of the components list is ready, the team will review and extend it if needed. Communication will continue in chat and the repo so all 11 team members (6 devs, 4 AQAs + Davide) can contribute and react early.

The team also confirmed:

* **Standalone Angular components should NOT be migrated now**. It would create unnecessary complexity.
* The plan is large, so a **step-by-step walkthrough** will be essential.
* Early next week is a realistic target for presenting the updated plan to the client, but Friday is too optimistic.

# **TODO List**

## **Your Actions (Pavel)**

* [ ] Create the **fake/dummy component set** today (based on descriptions only).
* [ ] Update the **test plan** today.
* [ ] Reload/adjust the **workshop plan**.
* [ ] Commit updates to the **public repo**.
* [ ] Notify the team when the first iteration of the component list is complete.
* [ ] Add a message to the big team chat (10+ members) to invite their input on missing components.
* [ ] Prepare a walkthrough version of the plan (as Davide mentioned).
* [ ] Keep in mind team size: **11 members** total when adjusting workload distribution.

## **Team Actions**

* [ ] Review the updated plan once Pavel publishes it.
* [ ] Suggest additional components or functionality types used in the real project.
* [ ] Confirm whether the timeline for next week’s client presentation is realistic.
* [ ] Prepare justification if hackathon dates need shifting.

## **Decision Points**

* [ ] Validate internally early next week: Are we ready to present the plan to the client?
* [ ] On the upcoming call: finalise the hackathon dates or request additional prep time.

## **Constraints / Agreements**

* No migration to **standalone Angular components** at this stage.
* Hackathon targeted for **week 2 of December**, but flexibility preserved.
* The repo is the main source of truth; everyone should watch it.

If you want, I can also prepare:

* A Slack/Teams message summarizing this for the team.
* A short update you can post in the repo.
* A one-page client-ready summary draft.
